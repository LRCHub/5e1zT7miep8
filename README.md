```lrc
[00:11.82] Days seem sometimes as if they'll never end
[00:17.26] Sun digs its heels to taunt you
[00:22.47] But after sunlit days, one thing stays the same
[00:26.65] Rises the moon
[00:33.65] 
[00:33.37] Days fade into a watercolour blur
[00:38.80] Memories swim and haunt you
[00:43.87] But look into the lake, shimmering like smoke
[00:47.93] Rises the moon
[00:54.93] 
[00:54.70] Oh-oh, close your weary eyes
[01:02.37] I promise you that soon the autumn comes
[01:04.76] To darken fading summer skies
[01:12.72] Breathe, breathe, breathe
[01:25.22] 
[01:25.81] Days pull you down just like a sinking ship
[01:30.85] Floating is getting harder
[01:36.11] But tread the water, child, and know that meanwhile
[01:40.17] Rises the moon
[01:47.17] 
[01:46.51] Days pull you up just like a daffodil
[01:51.66] Uprooted from its garden
[01:56.98] They'll tell you what you owe, but know even so
[02:00.99] Rises the moon
[02:07.99] 
[02:07.47] You'll be visited by sleep
[02:14.91] I promise you that soon the autumn comes
[02:17.44] To steal away each dream you keep
[02:25.51] Breathe, breathe, breathe
